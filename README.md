## D(St)reams of Anomalies

The goal of this project was to detect anaomalies in data. I took data that described the amount of taxi riders in NYC in 2014 through 2015. I imported the data and used feature engineering to better understand the data. 

I applied the interquartile range (IQR) and Isolation Forest algorithm to detect anomalies in the data. 

I found that most anomalies occured during Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas.
